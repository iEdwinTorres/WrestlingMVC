# Read Me

## Summary
This project is definitely not completed. CRUD functionality is not complete as of the writing of this document. CREATE, READ are fully functional. Update is mostly working with some caveats. And DELETE was not implemented, was holding off on it since it was easy and UPDATE gave me a lot more problems.

## Resources
1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

ChatGPT was invaluable. It helped me build out a lot of the functionality I did make. I am especially happy about how the PromotionId dropdown in ChampionshipCreate.cs/cshtml worked out. With help from ChatGPT and some JavaScript, it's pretty slick, I think.

2. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia)

Here is where I took most of the data that was put into the database. It's Wikipedia, how much more can I say?

3. [Restaurant Rater MVC](https://elevenfifty.instructure.com/courses/975/modules/items/117070)

This module basically guided me through this assignment. Didn't seem like a lot when it was just 2 properties and 1 table. But my project was 4 tables, most with at least 6 columns. It definitely became a handful.
